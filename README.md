# NCESchools

**NCESchools** is a Python package designed to search for and extract detailed information about public and private schools from the NCES (National Center for Education Statistics) website. This package allows users to search for schools by name, city, state, and zip code, and retrieve various details such as enrollment, student-teacher ratios, and more.

## Overview

The `NCESchools` package offers the following functionalities:

- **Search Schools:** Search for public or private schools by name, location, and other parameters.
- **Extract School Information:** Extract detailed information directly from the NCES website.
- **Specialized Fetchers:** Handle both public and private school searches with dedicated fetchers.

This package builds on the NCES [Public](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/) and [Private](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/privateschoolsearch/index.asp) school search pages. For more information, visit [The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the `NCESchools` package to search and extract details for both public and private schools:

```python
from nceschools import SchoolSearcher, PublicSchoolFetcher, PrivateSchoolFetcher

def main():
    # Example usage for a public school
    print("Public School Search and Extraction:")
    public_searcher = SchoolSearcher(school_type='public')
    
    # Search for a public school and extract details
    school_name = "Shiloh High School"
    city = "Snellville"
    state = "GA"
    zip_code = "30039"

    print(f"Searching for {school_name} in {city}, {state}, {zip_code}...")
    public_nces_id = public_searcher.get_nces_id(school_name, city=city, state=state, zip_code=zip_code)
    
    if public_nces_id:
        print(f"Public School NCES ID: {public_nces_id}")
        
        public_fetcher = PublicSchoolFetcher()
        public_html = public_fetcher.get_public_school_html(public_nces_id)
        school_details = public_fetcher.extract_school_details(public_html)
        
        print("Extracted School Details:")
        for key, value in school_details.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
    else:
        print(f"No public school found for {school_name} in {city}, {state}, {zip_code}.")

    # Example usage for a private school
    print("\nPrivate School Search and Extraction:")
    private_searcher = SchoolSearcher(school_type='private')
    
    # Search for a private school and extract details
    school_name = "Fuqua School"
    city = "Farmville"
    state = "VA"
    zip_code = "23901"

    print(f"Searching for {school_name} in {city}, {state}, {zip_code}...")
    private_nces_id = private_searcher.get_nces_id(school_name, city=city, state=state, zip_code=zip_code)
    
    if private_nces_id:
        print(f"Private School NCES ID: {private_nces_id}")
        
        private_fetcher = PrivateSchoolFetcher()
        private_html = private_fetcher.get_private_school_html(private_nces_id)
        school_details = private_fetcher.extract_school_details(private_html)
        
        print("Extracted School Details:")
        for key, value in school_details.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
    else:
        print(f"No private school found for {school_name} in {city}, {state}, {zip_code}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
